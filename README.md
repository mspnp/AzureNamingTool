# Azure Naming Tool

https://app-ant-prod.azurewebsites.net/

## Overview

The Azure Naming Tool was created to help administrators define and manage their naming conventions, while providing a simple interface for users to generate a compliant name. The tool was developed using a naming pattern based on [Microsoft's best practices](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/naming-and-tagging). Once an administrator has defined the organizational components, users can use the tool to generate a name for the desired Azure resource.
